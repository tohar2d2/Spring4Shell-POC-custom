# Spring4Shell PoC Application

This is a dockerized application that is vulnerable to the Spring4Shell vulnerability (CVE-2022-22965). Full Java source for the war is provided and modifiable, the war will get re-built whenever the docker image is built. The built WAR will then be loaded by Tomcat. ~~There is nothing special about this application, it's a simple hello world that's based off [Spring tutorials](https://spring.io/guides/gs/handling-form-submission/)~~ It's a landing page for a fictional company that makes purposefully vulnerable apps (Forked to make this).

Having issues with the POC? Check out the LunaSec fork at: https://github.com/lunasec-io/Spring4Shell-POC, it's more actively maintained.

## Requirements

1. Docker
2. Python3 + requests library

## Instructions

1. Clone the repository
2. Build and run the container: `docker build . -t spring4shell && docker run -p 8080:8080 spring4shell`
3. App should now be available at http://localhost:8080/helloworld/greeting

4. Run the exploit.py script:
 `python exploit.py --url "http://localhost:8080/helloworld/greeting"`

5. Visit the created webshell! Modify the `cmd` GET parameter for your commands. (`http://localhost:8080/shell.jsp` by default)

## Notes

**Fixed!** ~~As of this writing, the container (possibly just Tomcat) must be restarted between exploitations. I'm actively trying to resolve this.~~


Re-running the exploit will create an extra artifact file of {old_filename}_.jsp.
